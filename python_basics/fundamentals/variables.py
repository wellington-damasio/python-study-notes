# In python, a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. And a variable is always 
#associated with a value

message = 'Hello, World'
print(message)

message = 'Goodbye!'
print(message)

# Creating a variable 
# To define a variable in Python, use the following syntax
#      variable_name = value
# The value can be anything like a number, a string, etc...
counter = 1
print(counter)

# Naming variables
#   - Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a 
#   letter or an underscore, but not with a number
#   - Variable names connot contain spaces. To separate words in variables you can use underscores
#   - Variable names cannot be the same as keywords, reserved words, and built-in functions in Python

# The following guidelines help you define good variable names:
# - Variable names should be concise and descriptive.
# - Use underscores to separate multiple words in the variable names
# - Avoid using the letter 'l' and the letter 'O' in uppercase because they look like to number 1 and 0
