# Constants are like variables but their values don't change during the program executes 
# The bad news is that Python doesn't suppor constants

# To work around this, you can use all capital letters to name a variable to indicate that the
#variable should be treated as a constant
FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 2000 # (Kbytes)

print(FILE_SIZE_LIMIT)
